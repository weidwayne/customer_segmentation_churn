# Data
- 2 year of data on merchants and their transaction data on a payment platform

# Objectives
- understand customer payment activity to try to infer the types of merchants and identify different business in the sample
- identify and predict customer churn as sometimes a merchant may stop processing payments on the platform 
  - define customer churn from transactional data
  - identify merchants who have already churned in the dataset
  - build a model to predict which active merchants are mostly likely to churn in the near future
